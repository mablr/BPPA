**Duration**: 30 min.  
**Topics**: Code Quality, Readability, Documentation, Structure, Reproducibility, and Testing

## Introduction: Why doing things right?

Establishing and adopting programming best practices is especially useful for:

- Writing clean, maintainable code.
- Ensuring reproducibility and reliability.
- Working effectively with others.

Adopting this rigorous approach to good programming practices will benefit you on all levels, both academically and professionally.

## Best practices

### Code Quality and Readability

- Use **meaningful** names for your variables and functions.
- Follow **consistent** indentation and formatting.

**Before**

```python
def f(n):
 if n <= 1:
    return n
 else:
    return(f(n-1) + f(n-2))
```

**After**

```python
def fibonacci(number):
    if number <= 1:
        return number
    else:
        return fibonacci(number - 1) + fibonacci(number - 2)
```

### Documentation & Comments

- Write concise and relevant comments.
- Use docstrings for functions/classes to describe their purpose, inputs, and outputs.

**Before**

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        # Dog's constructor
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def bark(self):
        return "Woof!"

    def dog_years(self):
        # Return dog's age
        return self.age * 7
```

**After**

```python
class Dog:
    """
    A class to represent a dog.

    Attributes:
    name (str): The name of the dog.
    age (int): The age of the dog in human years.

    Methods:
    bark(): Returns the sound the dog makes.
    dog_years(): Calculates the dog's age in dog years.
    """

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        """
        Constructs all the necessary attributes for the dog object.

        Parameters:
        name (str): The name of the dog.
        age (int): The age of the dog in human years.
        """
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def bark(self):
        """
        Returns the sound the dog makes.

        Returns:
        str: The sound "Woof!".
        """
        return "Woof!"

    def dog_years(self):
        """
        Calculates the dog's age in dog years.

        Returns:
        int: The age of the dog in dog years.
        """
        return self.age * 7
```

### Code Structure

- Organize code into functions, objects, and modules.
- Avoid duplication (DRY principle: Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself).

**Before**

```python
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Calculate the square of each number
squares = []
for num in data:
    squares.append(num ** 2)

# Calculate the cube of each number
cubes = []
for num in data:
    cubes.append(num ** 3)
```

**After**

```python
class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def calculate_squares(self):
        return [num ** 2 for num in self.data]

    def calculate_cubes(self):
        return [num ** 3 for num in self.data]

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
processor = DataProcessor(data)
squares = processor.calculate_squares()
cubes = processor.calculate_cubes()
```

### Input Validation and Error Handling

- Always validate and sanitize inputs to ensure they are safe and expected.
- Verify input correctness and handle invalid inputs appropriately.
- Implement comprehensive error handling to manage all potential failure cases.

**Before**

```python
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b

a = float(input("Enter the numerator: "))
b = float(input("Enter the denominator: "))

result = divide(a, b)
print(result)
```

**After**

```python
def divide(a, b):
    try:
        return a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return "Error: Division by zero is not allowed."
    except TypeError:
        return "Error: Both inputs must be numbers."

def sanitize_input(prompt):
    while True:
        try:
            return float(input(prompt))
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")

a = sanitize_input("Enter the numerator: ")
b = sanitize_input("Enter the denominator: ")

result = divide(a, b)
print(result)
```

*Ensure that error messages do not reveal sensitive information such as system details, session identifiers, or account information.*

### Reproducibility

- Include clear instructions for setting up and running the program.
- Create requirements files for dependencies.

**Setting up a Python Virtual Environment**

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Freeze the installed dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

**Example `requirements.txt` file**:
```
numpy==2.2.1
pandas==2.2.3
matplotlib==3.10.0
```

### Unit Tests

- **Characteristics**:
    - **Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state left by other tests.
    - **Repeatability**: Tests should produce the same results every time they are run.
    - **Clarity**: Tests should be easy to read and understand.
    - **Coverage**: Aim to cover as many code paths as possible, including edge cases.

- **Structure**: the **AAA** pattern
    - **Arrange**: Prepare the environment and inputs for the test.
    - **Act**: Run the code being tested.
    - **Assert**: Verify that the result matches the expected one.

**Example using `unittest` in Python**: in `math_operations.py`

```python
import unittest

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

class TestMathOperations(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        """Setup any state specific to the execution of the given class."""
        self.a = 10
        self.b = 5

    def test_add(self):
        """Test the add function."""
        result = add(self.a, self.b)
        self.assertEqual(result, 15)

    def test_subtract(self):
        """Test the subtract function."""
        result = subtract(self.a, self.b)
        self.assertEqual(result, 5)

    def tearDown(self):
        """Clean up any resources used during the test."""
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

**Running the tests**:
```bash
python -m unittest math_operations.py
```
